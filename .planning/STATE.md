## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Modular monolith over microservices — solo developer + April 2026 deadline; ships faster, easier to debug
- Azure OpenAI primary, Anthropic Claude fallback — same tenant for lower latency; fallback prevents lock-in
- Read-only recommendations for MVP — no auto-execution; trust must be established first
- Tag-based attribution — Fileread consistently tags resources with `tenant_id`; direct mapping works

### Pending Todos
